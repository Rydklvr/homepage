Spotify generates a *Discover Weekly* playlist, which it updates every Monday. Usually I get around
to listening to it, but sometimes I don't, and when that happens, the songs it recommended for me that week are lost.

What if instead we could set up a *Discover Weekly Archive* playlist, which contains all the songs
that have ever been in your *Discover Weekly* playlist? Well, that's exactly what we're going to do!

Obviously, you'll first need an IFTTT account[^1] and a Spotify account[^2]. Although if you're reading
this you probably already have them.

You'll also need the *Discover Weekly* playlist, which starts getting generated after a few weeks of
listening. If you don't see it, search for it, or listen to more music.

## The IFTTT applet

All you need to do is connect your IFTTT account to your Spotify account, then enable the
*Automatically create a Discover Weekly archive* applet. From then on, every Monday, your *Discover Weekly*
songs will be copied into your *Discover Weekly Archive* playlist.

Mine can be found [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0jeBz1iUtR9LMZwpB8X1Bb?si=PBxMmvWUTkG-E25y1H3TXQ)
if you want to take a look. I've got over 4,900 songs in it!
